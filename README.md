##Disclaimer
Please note that app this is just for testing purposes and the project is unfinished.
    - Make sure that the access tokens are randomly generated by user and you keep it secret (note that at the moment the application is using it as user ID - which is wrong! )
    - If you see error "This program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.... " - please make sure you have .NET Framework installed
